# PRMIA-Risk-Management-Case

United Grain Growers Case.

This was a case competiton in which Abhishek Saha, Prajwal Kuchangi, Pooja Adiseshu, and I participated. We were regional finalist, but we could not go to NY to compete because of classes and program related commitments. Nevertheless, it was a learning experience.
